# Customer Segmentation
 Customer segmentation is the practice of dividing a customer base into groups of individuals that are similar in specific ways relevant to marketing. Customer segmentation relies on identifying key differentiators that divide customers into groups that can be targeted. Information such as a customers' demographics (age, race, religion, gender, family size, ethnicity, income, education level), geography (where they live and work), psychographic (social class, lifestyle and personality characteristics) and behavioral (spending, consumption, usage and desired benefits) tendencies are taken into account when determining customer segmentation practices.
 By enabling companies to target specific groups of customers, a customer segmentation model allows for the effective allocation of marketing resources and the maximization of cross- and up-selling opportunities. When a group of customers is sent personalized messages as part of a marketing mix that is designed around their needs, it's easier for companies to send those customers special offers meant to encourage them to buy more products. Customer segmentation can also improve customer service and assist in customer loyalty and retention. As a by-product of its personalized nature, marketing materials sent out using customer segmentation tend to be more valued and appreciated by the customer who receives them as opposed to impersonal brand messaging that doesn't acknowledge purchase history or any kind of customer relationship.

Market Basket Analysis is a technique which identifies the strength of association between pairs of products purchased together and identify patterns of co-occurrence. A co-occurrence is when two or more things take place together. One of the methods is called association-rules.
